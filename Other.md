Theme arrangement:

The address that sets themes for each level is located at 0x1B6AF0.

The format is simple, each byte sets the theme of a stage based

on the offset of the byte. Here's what Super Monkey Ball's theme

array looks like:

0D0D0D0D0F0F0F0F0F01

0D0D0D0D... and so on

So if you were to change the first byte,

that would change the theme for the first stage.



Theme list:

0 = NULL                    }

1 = TYPE A / Sky             }

2 = TYPE B / Night           }

3 = TYPE C / Sunset          }

4 = TYPE D / Water           }

5 = TYPE E / Storm           } - Monkey Ball themes

6 = TYPE F / Ice             }

7 = TYPE G / Sand            }

8 = TYPE H / Space           }

9 = TYPE I / Cave            }

A = TYPE J / Bonus / Master  }

B = E3 (unknown)

C = Jungle

D = Water

E = Night

F = Sun

10 = Space

11 = Sand

12 = Ice

13 = Storm

14 = Bonus

15 = Pilot (crashes if stage isn't already a Monkey Target level)

16 = Billiards

17 = Golf

18 = Bowling

19 = Master

1A = Ending



You can also find this using Test Mode.



Challenge mode:



The address for this can be found at 0x1B7730.



Most of it is already explained via SMB Level Workshop Discord,

but one thing about the stage time is that the value is stored in

a short byte, so if the value goes over 0x7FFF, the time faults

back to zero, even resulting in the timer explosion animation

happening right before the player can move.



# Going past 200 stages

Yes, that's right, you can have challenge mode difficulties have stages

with an ID value higher than 200, though it won't change how many stages

are viewable or playable via the non-difficulty stage select list in

Test Mode. The value that sets the stage ID uses a short value, so setting

it past 0x7FFF causes it to go negative.



# /test/



This section doesn't go into far analysis

of the files but just a quick explanation of how

they're used and what they represent.



- The "preview" folder contains pictures for practice mode/race

track thumbnails and next-level images that appear from the sky.

- CRASH_STAR appears many times in a few common model files.

- SMB levels use .gma and .tpl to create the level model, while

the original Monkey Ball levels use st???_p.lz and st???.lz.

- Stage 190 (in debug) is used for the main menu.

- The intro depends on Stage 99, 71, 61, 101, Advanced 3, Beginner 10,

Advanced 11, Expert 40 (last bonus).

- When playing music, the game will repeatedly read from the music file

(if you were to use procmon.exe, you will see) instead of completely

loading it into memory, so if the file is deleted, it will still try

to read from it, but you will hear nothing, until the file is put back

into place.

- The folder labeled "stage" is Beginner 1 and is used in

test mode for various tests.

- st000 is empty and is never used.



# Dialog format



This feature is what I call AVTEXT, and it works like this:



usage:

?/text(/)



Normal text:

a/text



Bold text:

b/a/text



Colored text:

c/0xff0000/a/text



Picture:

p/NAME/



Button A: p/BUTTON_A/

Button B: p/BUTTON_B/

etc.



Arrows:

Left: p/SANNKAKU_L/

Up: p/SANNKAKU_U/

Down: p/SANNKAKU_D/

Right: p/SANNKAKU_R/



D-pad: p/BUTTON_+/



Camera-Stick: p/LEVEL/



San(n)kaku means Triangulate in Japanese



Japanese/Katana:

h/non-katana text

k/idk what this is yet



Special special (like actual Japanese letters or accent letters)

characters used in a/ texts breaks the game.
